# co-test

Except this file, everything are same as of our session start time
- As said, I believe that I can better architect the Scenario 2, I did design many solutions. IT is not excuse but for first task, failed to git push attempt and a wrong typo takes my extra ten minutes (weather - wheather). So I could not find enough time for proper design shapes, and decided quicker IaaS based solution. However, I can assure you that I designed  EKS, ECS and AKS solutions in my past.

# next time for scenario 1 
- add lint in github actions
- github autoneticate on AWS (role, etc)
- check terraform best practices (official and google)
- proper tagging (cost center etc)
- terraform: s3 bucket and dynamodb, lock table, statefile, etc
- create a pipeline (AWS documents, etc. accept user input for terraform steps)
- code deploy: better: MR auto triggered, fully automated, CI/CD 
- github role should be in gen env.
- python version to image tag and ecr immutable
